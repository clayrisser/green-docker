# Dockerfile Guide

I based this guide on personal advice from [@creak](https://github.com/creack), co-creator of Docker, as well as my own
experience and mistakes building, deploying and maintaining hundreds of Dockerfiles. [@creak](https://github.com/creack)
was the #1 contributor to Docker during its first year. I owe my enthusiasm with Docker to a day
[@creak](https://github.com/creack) sat down with me and showed me ropes.
