# Dockerfile Guide

I based this guide on personal advice from [@creak](https://github.com/creack), co-creator of Docker, as well as my own
experience and mistakes building, deploying and maintaining hundreds of Dockerfiles. [@creak](https://github.com/creack)
was the [#1 contrubuter](https://github.com/moby/moby/graphs/contributors?from=2013-01-13&to=2014-01-31&type=c) to Docker
during its first year. I owe my enthusiasm with Docker to a day [@creak](https://github.com/creack) sat down with me and
showed me ropes.

### Use a minimal base
Use a minimal base when possible. [Busybox](https://hub.docker.com/_/busybox/) is the most minimal base, but it lacks package 
management. I recommend using [Alpine](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine/) because it is the most minimal that supports package 
management.

### Use official images for the base
Official images help prevent unexpected bugs because a professional team of developers continually maintains them.

### Use versioned tags for the base
Versioned tags also help prevent bugs. A base that is not versioned may change without you knowing, and could break the 
Docker image.

### Stick to Linux conventions
Docker images are a containerized system that shares the Linux kernel with the host machine. Because a Docker image is 
essentially a Linux system, it is advised to use Linux conventions when possible. Put binaries in `/usr/local/bin`. Put 
scripts in `/usr/local/sbin`. Put source code in `/usr/local/src`. Put applications in `/opt`. Usually, I place my main app 
in `/opt/app`, but some people might prefer to put it in `/usr/local/src/app`. Just use your best judgment.

### Chain instructions
Each docker instruction creates a new layer. In order to minimize the number of layers, itâ€™s best to chain your commands 
using `&&`. You can use `\` to continue an instruction onto another line.

### Install dependancies before copying application
Since layers are cached, the build can reuse them when nothing has changed in the current and previous layers. Because of 
this, copy your dependency list over first, such as your `package.json` or `requirements.txt`. Next, install your 
dependencies. Then copy the rest of the application. When you make a change in your app, it will pull the cached layer that
installed your dependencies instead of reinstalling the same dependencies all over again.

### Clean up build dependancies
Cleaning up your build dependencies helps ensure your image is as small as possible.

### Catch **SIGINT** signal
Use a program like tini or supervisord to catch the SIGINT signal. Otherwise, your docker container will not shutdown on 
`CTRL-C`, which can be frustrating to users.

### Use ENTRYPOINT and CMD correctly
Use ENTRYPOINT for running your main program, and CMD to pass the default arguments. This practice ensures the user can 
override the arguments without the user needing to know how to run the program.
