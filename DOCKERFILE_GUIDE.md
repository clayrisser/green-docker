# Dockerfile Guide

This guide is based on personal advice from [@creak](https://github.com/creack), co-creator of Docker, as well as my
own expirience and mistakes building, deploying, and maintaining hundreds of Dockerfiles. [@creak](https://github.com/creack)
was the [#1 contrubuter](https://github.com/moby/moby/graphs/contributors?from=2013-01-13&to=2014-01-31&type=c) to Docker
during its first year. I owe my enthusiasm with Docker to a day [@creak](https://github.com/creack) sat down with me and
showed me ropes.
